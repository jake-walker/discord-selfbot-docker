# Discord Selfbot (Docker)

This selfbot is written by [appu1232](https://github.com/appu1232) and this is simply just a Docker container with [appu1232's bot](https://github.com/appu1232/Discord-Selfbot) running inside.

### Get your bot token from Discord
1. On Discord press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> on Windows or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⌥</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> on Mac.
1. Look at [this image](https://imgur.com/h3g9uf6) to see where to get your token.

**Note:** ***Your token allows full access to your Discord account. Don't give it to anyone you don't trust fully.*** *If you happen to change your password or enable/disable 2FA your token will change, so be sure to update it if you do.*
